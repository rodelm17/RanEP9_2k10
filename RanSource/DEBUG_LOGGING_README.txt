DEBUG LOGGING FOR BACKGROUND CHARACTERS
========================================

WHAT THIS DOES:
===============

‚úÖ Adds comprehensive logging to DXLANDSKINOBJ::Render()
‚úÖ Logs every background character that gets rendered
‚úÖ Shows what equipment pieces each character has
‚úÖ Shows the grind level of each equipment piece
‚úÖ Helps debug why +9 effects aren't working

WHERE THE LOGS GO:
==================

**Log File Location**: `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Ran Online\ErrorLog\`
**Log File Name**: `log.YYYYMMDDHHMM.txt` (e.g., `log.202412011430.txt`)

**Full Path Example**: 
```
C:\Users\Resty\Documents\Ran Online\ErrorLog\log.202412011430.txt
```

**How to Find**:
1. **Open File Explorer**
2. **Go to Documents folder**
3. **Look for "Ran Online" folder**
4. **Open "ErrorLog" subfolder**
5. **Find the most recent log file** (newest timestamp)

WHAT THE LOGS WILL SHOW:
========================

1. **Character Loading**:
   ```
   [14:30:15] DXLANDSKINOBJ::Render CALLED for: login_man (FileName: login_man.chf)
   [14:30:15]   - Creating SkinChar...
   [14:30:15]   - SkinChar created successfully
   [14:30:15]   - Character has 8 equipment pieces
   [14:30:15]     Piece 0: NO FILE
   [14:30:15]     Piece 1: body.cps (Grind Level: 0)
   [14:30:15]     Piece 2: leg.cps (Grind Level: 0)
   [14:30:15]     Piece 3: hand.cps (Grind Level: 0)
   [14:30:15]     Piece 4: foot.cps (Grind Level: 0)
   [14:30:15]     Piece 5: weapon.cps (Grind Level: 0)
   [14:30:15]     Piece 6: NO FILE
   [14:30:15]     Piece 7: NO FILE
   [14:30:15] DXLANDSKINOBJ::Render COMPLETED for: login_man
   ```

2. **Error Cases**:
   ```
   [14:30:16] DXLANDSKINOBJ::Render CALLED for: some_npc (FileName: npc.chf)
   [14:30:16]   - ERROR: PlaySkinChar failed with HR: -2147467259
   ```

HOW TO USE:
===========

1. **Compile the client** with the logging code ‚úÖ
2. **Run the client** and go to login screen ‚úÖ
3. **Check the log file** in `Documents\Ran Online\ErrorLog\` ‚úÖ
4. **Look for** DXLANDSKINOBJ entries ‚úÖ

**Quick Access**:
- **Windows Key + R** ‚Üí Type: `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Ran Online\ErrorLog\` ‚Üí Enter
- **Or navigate**: Documents ‚Üí Ran Online ‚Üí ErrorLog

WHAT TO LOOK FOR:
=================

‚úÖ **Characters with equipment**: These should get +9 effects
‚ùå **Characters without equipment**: These won't show +9 effects
‚ùå **Loading errors**: These indicate problems with character files
‚ùå **Missing pieces**: Characters might be missing certain equipment slots

EXPECTED RESULTS:
=================

**If everything works correctly**, you should see:
- Background characters being rendered
- Equipment pieces with filenames
- Grind levels (initially 0, then should become 9)

**If there are problems**, you might see:
- No DXLANDSKINOBJ entries (wrong rendering path)
- Characters with no equipment pieces
- Loading errors
- Missing character files

NEXT STEPS:
===========

After checking the logs:
1. **Identify which characters have equipment**
2. **Check if equipment pieces are loading correctly**
3. **Verify if our +9 code is running**
4. **Fix any loading or equipment issues**

**IMPORTANT**: The log file is created with a timestamp, so each time you run the client, a new log file will be created. Look for the most recent one!

This logging will give us the real answer to why +9 effects aren't working! üîç
